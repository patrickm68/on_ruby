  h2 Still looking for a location!

  h3 How can you help?
  p
    ' We are always looking for new locations for our Meetups.
    ' If you want to host one of the events at your company
    => mail_to Whitelabel[:email], "drop us a line", title: "#{Whitelabel[:twitter]} E-Mail"
    ' or mention us on twitter #{link_to_twitter Whitelabel[:twitter]}
    ' or contact one of the organizers:
  = render 'users/list', users: organizers

  h3 How much space do we need?
  p
    ' There have been
    em' #{stats[:participants]} Rubyists
    ' signed up on average for the latest events and there were about
    em' #{stats[:topics]} to #{stats[:topics] + 1} presentations
    ' held.
    ' Those numbers are just guidelines, make sure to talk to one of the organizers
    ' when preparing the hosting.
  p
    | If you don't have a lot of space, it's also possible to limit the number of participants.

  h3 What's needed for a Usergroup?
  p
    ' The location, of course, but there is more to it:
    ul.enumeration
      li alcohol free beverages
      li beamer and adapters
      li beer (optional)
      li snacks/pizza (optional)
    ' You don't need to make a fuss, we are cool with the bare minimum!

  h2 Thanks for your help!
